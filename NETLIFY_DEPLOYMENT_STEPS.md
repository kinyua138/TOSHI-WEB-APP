3. You'll see the main dashboard

### Step 3: Deploy via Drag & Drop
1. Look for the section that says **"Want to deploy a new site without connecting to Git?"**
2. **Drag and drop** the entire `frontend/build` folder onto the deployment area
3. Netlify will automatically:
   - Upload your files
   - Deploy your site
   - Give you a random URL like `https://amazing-name-123456.netlify.app`

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

2. Add these variables:
   ```

   ```
3. Click **Save**

### Step 5: Redeploy with Environment Variables

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Build Fails
**Error**: "Build script returned non-zero exit code"

**Solution**:
1. Check if `netlify.toml` is in the `frontend` folder
2. Verify build command in Netlify settings:
   - Base directory: `frontend`
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `frontend/build`

### Issue 2: API Calls Not Working
**Error**: Network errors or CORS issues

**Solution**:
1. Verify environment variables are set correctly
2. Check that backend URL is accessible: `https://toshi-web-app.onrender.com/api/health`
3. Ensure CORS is configured in backend for your Netlify URL

### Issue 3: Routing Issues (404 on refresh)
**Error**: Page not found when refreshing

**Solution**: The `netlify.toml` file should handle this with redirects:
```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```
